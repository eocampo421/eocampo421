I have been working as a Software Engineer for almost 8 years, the programming language that I am most experienced is Java, I'm also worked with Python as secondary language.
All over my career I have gained a lot of experience working on challenging projects. The knowledge I got not only was technical, I also have obtained soft skills like communication, time management, decision-making, teamwork.
The tech experience I have gotten includes on prem as well as cloud applications. 
Currently, I am inspiring to keep augmenting my knowledge in order to deliver a serious work on time using agile methodologies.
